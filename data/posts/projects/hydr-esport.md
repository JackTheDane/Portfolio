Hydr Esport is a company that specializes in offering coaching and tournaments for Esport competitors, but also regular hobbyists and companies wanting to hold Esport events for their employees.

Hydr Esport's website was originally designed and developed by a third party, but needed to be updated with a series of more advanced features, to make it more streamlined and maintainable. For this, I was hired as a consultant to implement these features, with a focus on user-friendliness so that the company would be able to manage the site after delivery.

The site was developed using WordPress, and then extended using _Custom Post Types_ to manage training sessions, with _Advanced Custom Fields_ for adding necesarry meta data and extending page templates.
