Dental Media ApS is a digital marketing agency and software provider aimed at helping dentists worldwide to get more patients into their clinics.

During my time with Dental Media, the company was expanding internationally, and wanted a new website to reflect this with a more modern design and sleek feel to describe the various services that the company offers. I was given the task of designing and implementing this website, building around the WordPress Drag n' Drop theme called _Avada_, with a focus on easy content updates in the future.

For a faster development and more, I proposed that the site should be developed on a local machine, using the CSS preprocessor _SCSS_ and the task runner _Gulp_. This allowed for both developer benefits, such as Hot Reloading, as well as smaller CSS and JS bundle sizes through minification and smart bundling in the Gulp build steps. The site was developed in part, using the SCSS framework _Bootstrap_, and so _PurifyCSS_ was also implemented to help strip out any parts of the CSS framework that were not being used on the site, further minimizing the amount of code sent to the user.

The project was put online in 2018, and remains online today, where it serves to inform dentists around the world of the benefits that Dental Media can provide for them.
